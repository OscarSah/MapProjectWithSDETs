The purpose of this practice is to collaborate as a group in work-like scenario

5 Groups:
    Gr1 - Oscar, Charos, Reza, Leyli, h, Naima
    Gr2 - Angel, Busra, Evgeniya, Barno, Sule, Onnipa
    Gr3 - Cetin, Manal, Leila, Fatma, Jahan,

Leaders are gonna create a JAVA project and collaborators to their project

Each collaborator (each person) will contribute their own group

git init  -- enables VCS
git add .   -- adds everything to staging
git commit -m "add: first commit"  -- is for commiting with a message
git remote add origin <your_remote_origin>  --  added remote origin (shared the project on Github)
git push -u origin main  --- we sent the chages to remote


**** Real Work environment branching strategy ****
1. Collaborators created a branch from main/develop branch
2. Executed their coding/automation task and commited to their branch locally
3. Pushed their branch to remote for pull request and after review by team members merging to main
4. After merging to main at the remote, we check out local main branch and pull/update the project

Main/develop/master : Your applications base branch are protected
            - Automated tests that checks code errors / code smells
            - test that checks branch name, pull request format etc.
            - if it is a development code our smoke tests are initiated automatically
            - then a person (dev. tester) reviews the code
            - the code is merged to BASE branch
