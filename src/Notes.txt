Leaders are gonna create a JAVA project and collaborators to their project

Each collaborator (each person) will contribute their own group

git init  -- enables VCS
git add .   -- adds everything to staging
git commit -m "add: first commit"  -- is for commiting with a message
git remote add origin <your_remote_origin>  --  added remote origin (shared the project on Github)
git push -u origin main  --- we sent the chages to remote
